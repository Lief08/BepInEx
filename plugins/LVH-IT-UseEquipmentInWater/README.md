# Use Equipment in Water for Valheim
This Bepinex mod allows you to use all of your equipment and tools while swimming in water.  
You can also choose which items are usable in water by editing the config file as explained below.  

# Important Info
For now (v0.2.4) the config file does not work anymore. That means every Item is allowed to be used in Water no matter what.  
Thats because the latest update makes my mod require a rewrite in order to allow or deny specific items.  
I will look into fixing that later
